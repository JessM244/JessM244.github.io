### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorites because it felt like a sort of initiation into the class, and it was the first time feeling a sense of gratification when the program worked exactly as intended. I also enjoyed how simple it was compared to later labs. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was one of my favorites because I liked being able to look back and see how my skill as a programmer has improved. Seeing the progress from the first blackjack program and comparing it to this one showed to me that I've made progress in the class. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was one of my favorites because it created something interactable and tangible. I could show this to someone with absolutely no knowledge and I donâ€™t have to show them any of the code behind it. To me, this felt like the first lab where it felt like you were manipulating something from behind the scenes.
